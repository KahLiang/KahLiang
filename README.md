   Hi there 👋 I am Kah Liang!
</p>

## 😄 About Me
<p align="justify">
I love programming and I am enjoying in design and develop programs. Mostly, I am on the front-end side of web development. I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and PHP. I have developed a "Party Planner Booking System" as my final year project in my diploma.

I have experience in image classification for fruit & vegetables, pattern recognition for petrol stations, computer vision for social distancing monitoring and natural language processing for sentiment analysis on social media platforms. During my final year project in degree, I was doing research on sequence data analysis for sentiment analysis by texts.
