   Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Kah Liang!

## ðŸ˜„ About Me
<p align="justify">
I love programming and I am enjoying in design and develop programs. I first started looking into the idea to learn to code was during my diploma study. Mostly, I am on the front-end side of web development. I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and PHP. I have developed a "Party Planner Booking System" as my final year project in my diploma.

After my diploma study, I am taking a degree in Artificial Intelligence. I have experience in image classification for fruit & vegetables, computer vision for social distancing monitoring and natural language processing for sentiment analysis on social media platforms. During my final year project in degree, I was doing research on sequence data analysis for sentiment analysis by texts.
